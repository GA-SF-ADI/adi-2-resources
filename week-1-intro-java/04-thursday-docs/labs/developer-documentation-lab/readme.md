Practice using Developer Documentation to find answers to problems you encounter! This lab is broken into **3** group assignments. The first will have you use the `ArrayList` again. Next, you'll practice asking and answering questions that others will be able to understand. Finally, you'll learn a new class in Java and developer documentation to teach yourself the `StringBuilder`!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

This lab is broken into four parts:

**Properly Asking for Help (30 minutes)**

- Register for both a [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/) and **Stack Overflow** account
- Fill out your Stack Overflow profile details with as much detail as possible
- In a group, use developer documentation to research the `ArrayList` class
- Learn how to **add**, **find**, and **remove** elements within an ArrayList; if you don't get stuck, try **iterating** through items of the list or a different data collection class
- The first time you run into a problem, make your way to [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/)
- Review the contents of [Stack Overflow's 'How do I ask a good question?'](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- Come up with a question to help you answer the problem you and your group has run into and review your group's question to verify it's as clear as possible
- Post your question to GAQA! Feel free to browse other student's questions as they are posted


**Answering Questions (20 Minutes)**

Everyone, as a class, should review the questions that other students have posted (to make sure this happens, post a link to your question in the class Slack channel):

- Your instructor will assign one question to each group
- You have 15 minutes to research, using the official Java docs and the other online forums, and try to answer the question you've been assigned
- Provide an answer on GAQA within these 20 minutes
- Bonus: Answer other students' questions than the one your were assigned!

**Stack Overflow (30 minutes)**

In the past week, you have likely run into a problem:

- Brainstorm common problems or errors that you and your group mates have encountered so far in class
- Research them on Stack Overflow
- Upvote answers and comments that you find helpful or insightful
- Once you've completed this, it is time for you to learn something _new_ again!
- Research the `StringBuilder` class and use it to create a `String`
- StringBuilder is designed to build strings; instead of having to _concatenate by hand_, you can use this instead
- _When_ you run into a problem, you should use documentation to aid you!
- **If** you find that you have a _unique_ question, **you should post it!**
- **Otherwise** feel free to comment and upvote answers that you find helpful!
- Bonus: Build a script that uses StringBuilder! Push it to GitHub!

**Wrap Up (5 minutes)**

- Ask questions! Let's get everything out.
- What hurt? What felt great?
- What was the largest takeaway for you from this lab?

#### Starter code

No starter code for this one!

#### Deliverable

There should be questions on [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/) from each group with answers from different groups!
