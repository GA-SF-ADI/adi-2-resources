## Introduction


This lab provides an opportunity to practice creating functions!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Please write code that implements various functions, following the requirements in the list below:

- Define a function `maxOfTwoNumbers` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. I would suggest using conditional statements. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.

- Define a function `maxOfThree` that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.

- Write a function `isCharacterAVowel` that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

- Write a function that return the number of arguments passed to the function when called.

- Define a function `reverseString` that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".

**Bonus**

- Write a function `findLongestWord` that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.

- Write a function `filterLongWords` that takes an array of words and a number `i` and returns the array of words that are longer than i characters long.

- Create a class, Car, that has the following member variables: mTopSpeed and mNumberOfDoors. In that class, write a constructor method that assigns random values to the member variables. Also, write a method that prints out the line "Your car has the top speed of ___ mph, and for some reason has ____ doors."

#### Starter Code

There is no starter code for this lab.

#### Deliverable

You'll review the answers with the instructor in class.
