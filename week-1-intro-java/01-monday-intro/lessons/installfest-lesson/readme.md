# Let's get you setup to attend the "Intro to Java for Android" workshop (for Mac)

Before you attend the "Introduction to Java for Android" workshop, you need to download and install a few tools. Follow this guide to help you get set up, and we'll see you in class!

## Java Development Kit

Before anything else, you need to install Java on your system. This can be a little tricky and requires a little bit of coding; don't panic and make sure to follow these steps closely:

1 ) Go to <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

2 ) Download Java Platform JDK (see image below)

3 ) Select the `Mac OS X x64` option under the Java SE Development Kit box (see image below)

4 ) Make sure to accept terms & agreements

5 ) Open the `.dmg` file and follow installation steps

6 ) Verify that Java has installed successfully by opening the `Terminal` app on your Mac (you can search for Terminal using Spotlight search on your Mac)

8 ) If you see `java version` as 1.8 or greater, you're good to go!

3. Agree to Terms & Conditions
4. Launch the `.dmg` file that you just downloaded
5. Drag and drop Android Studio into the Applications folder

## Setting Up Android Studio + SDK

1. Open Android Studio from your Applications folder
2. Click next on the welcome screen.
3. Click next for Java Settings (you should've installed Java already!)
4. Choose "Standard" for the install type, click next.
5. Click "Accept" for the SDK License Agreements as well as the `intel-android-extra-license`, click Finish.
