# Data Types HW: Autoboxing

Today we learned about data types in Java, and one thing important that was noted was the difference between primitive data types and objects. To review,:

* A _primitive_ data type is a piece of data that is passed by value. 

* An _Object_ in Java has methods and attributes.

* Primitive data types pass data by reference; Objects pass data by value.

Autoboxing in Java is what happens when the Java compiler converts a primitive to its wrapper class - for example, between an int and an Integer, a char and a Character, or a long and a Long. Converting the other way (from wrapper type to primitive) is called unboxing. 

For this homework, please read through the following javadoc and brief tutorial.

After reading these, make note of the following:

* 3 cases when autoboxing can occur, with examples

* 3 cases when unboxing can occur, with examples

* What do you think best practices are when it comes to data types and comparative operations, and why?
