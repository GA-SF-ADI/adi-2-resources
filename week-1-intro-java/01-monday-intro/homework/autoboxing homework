**3 cases when autoboxing can occur with examples:**

Autoboxing is converting an a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class.  For example, int:Integer.

1) when a method is expecting wrapper class object but the value being passed as the parameter is a primitive type.
2)when at some point in time you are assigning a primitive type value to an object of its wrapper class
3) When dealing with collection framework classes

**3 cases when unboxing can occur with examples:
Unboxing is converting a wrapper type (Integer) to its corresponding primitive (int) value.

1) method is expecting Integer object(parameter) but we have supplied an int.
2) assignments
3) when dealing with collection classes

**What is best practice when it comes to data types and comparative operations and why?**
Be careful to keep primitives and objects totally separate when doing comparisons, otherwise you may not get correct results.
To avoid confusion, when comparing objects with objects always use the equals() method.
When comparing primitives you should always use logical operators.
