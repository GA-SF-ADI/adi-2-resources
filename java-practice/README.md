## Tutorialspoint Java explanations:
Visit the [link](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/index.htm) 

#### Java Tutorial Section
- Read all subsections on the left hand side. 
- Read all topics we covered in class to re-inforce what you learned. 
- Topics are **at least** Variables, data types, Arrays, ArrayLists, Control Flow, Methods, Modifiers, Basic Syntax, etc.

**Don't worry too much about the following sections but do explore them if you have time:**
- Files & I/O
- Regular Expressions
- Date and Time


#### Java Object Oriented
- Read all subsections on the left hand side to prepare for **Week 2**.


## Practice Syntax!
- It is very important for you to know syntax by heart. There is no logic to it besides memorizing when and where we use brackets, parentheses, colons, semi-colons, etc. Java is a language just like English is (which tells us when/where to put comas, periods, etc).

My suggestion is to do the following exercises inside a new IntelliJ project ( on a new **java-practice** branch ):

#### If Statements
- Write 25 if-statements that switch on an int
- Write 25 if-statements that switch on a double
- Write 25 if-statements that switch on a String
- Write if-statements that switch on a float
- [Example](switch-statement-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/ifStatements/IfStatements.java)

#### Switch Statements
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on an int
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a String
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a double
- Write 25 switch statements that switch on a float
- [Example](switch-statement-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/switchStatements/SwitchStatements.java)

#### For loops
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 for loops that iterate over a float
- Bonus: Write above enhanced versions of above for loops ( using "for-each" notation )
- [Example](loops-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/Loops/ForLoops.java)

#### While loops
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 while loops that iterate over a float
- [Example](loops-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/Loops/WhileLoops.java)

#### Do-While loops
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over an int
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a double
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a String
- Write 25 do-while loops that iterate over a float
- [Example](loops-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/Loops/DoWhileLoops.java)

#### Methods
- Write 15 Methods return void and have no arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return int and have no arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return double and have no arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return float and have no arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return String and have no arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return void and have 1 argument
- Write 15 Methods that return int and have 2 arguments
- Write 15 Methods that return String and have 3 arguments
- [Example](method-examples/src/com/generalassembly/alex/Main.java)
