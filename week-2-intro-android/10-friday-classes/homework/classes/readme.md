## Classes Homework 

This assignment aims to give you more confidence in writing and using your own Java classes, and writing *constructors* for your classes as well as *getters* and *setters* for custom classes.

#### Tasks:

Create Classes to model the following real world objects:
  
  1. Create a "Contact" class that models are contact from your phone. Write getters and setters for each field, and make your fields *private*. This class should have a constructor that has at least a name and phone number arguments.
  
  2. Create a "PhoneBook" class that models a phone book. This class should hold a list of "Contacts" and have these methods: `removeContact()`, `addContact()`, and `getContactList()`. This class should have 2 constructors: One that takes no contact list and one that takes a contact list.
  
  
Now, inside your `Main.java`, create 2 PhoneBook instances: One for iPhone that has an existing list of contacts, and one for Android that has no contacts. Next, do the following:

* copy the iPhone contacts to the Android contacts. 
* Remove all iPhone contacts using the Android contact list.
