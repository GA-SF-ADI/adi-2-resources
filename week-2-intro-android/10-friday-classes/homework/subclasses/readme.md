# Subclasses Homework

This homework assignment will build off of the Classes homework you've already done.

## Tasks:

Subclass phone book and create Android phone book. 

  * Android phone book should at a minimum take a float as android version in constructor, and also android version and existing contact list. 
  * Android phone book class needs a method to check if android version is supported ( supported only if > 4.0f ).
  
  * Inside PhoneBook.java add a private String field for "phoneBookType" that is initialized to "phoneBook". Create a getter and a setter for this field.
  
  * Inside AndroidPhoneBook constructor, set the "phoneBookType" value to "Android".
  
  * Inside Main.java, update the "androidBook" to be of type AndroidPhoneBook and initialize its constructor with version "2.0f".
  
  * Now check if the version is supported, if so then copy the iphone contacts over. If not, then do not copy the contacts and print that version is not supported.
