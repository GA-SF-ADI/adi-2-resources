We will be using the Espresso testing framework provided by Google to test basic functionality of our Android apps. While these won't cover all test cases, they will allow you to re-test core functions within your app with a single click. Use the following guide on the Android Developers website to set up your project to use Espresso.

- [Testing with Espresso](http://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html)

There are two files in this directory, ``MainActivityEspressoTest.java`` and ``ToDoListActivityEspressoTest.java``.

These files go in your androidTest folder in your project directory. The instructor solution code contains two activities, so there is one test file for each activity. You need to modify the provided files to match your app design, since your general layout and ids won't necessarily match the examples provided. Feel free to add your own tests, these examples are just a starting point. To run the tests for an individual activity, right click on the java file from within the project pane in Android Studio, and choose Run 'YourJavaFileName'.

**Ask the instructors for help if you need help!**
