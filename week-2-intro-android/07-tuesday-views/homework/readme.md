#Homework

There are two main parts to tonights homework, some prototyping and some reading. 

##Prototyping

Start thinking about your project 1! Remember that you can read the specifications [here](https://github.com/GA-SF-ADI/adi-2-resources/tree/master/projects/project-01). You don't need to finish this, just start thinking about it.

We will have time tomorrow to work on this more/collaborate on these! 

##Reading

We are going to be covering Activities and Intents tomorrow, which are a very important part of the android framework. Check out the Android docs on these subjects, which are

for activities and 

https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html

for intents. Don't worry too much about intent filters! 

##Garnet

Also, make sure to put a picture up on Garnet and make your name your real name!
