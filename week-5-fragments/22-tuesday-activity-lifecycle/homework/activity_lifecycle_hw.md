# Activity Lifecycle Review

The Android Activity Lifecycle is a very fundamental concept of Android development, and it's a great idea to understand this well, both for development and for interview preparation. Understanding this cycle and the states of activites will help you write better, more efficient code, and also help you understand the Android platform as a whole.

Please complete the following: 

1. Without looking at references, first list out the Android Activity Lifecycle methods (in order), and to the best of your knowledge write the meaning of each method. 

2. Without looking at references, draw out a flow chart of the Android Activity lifecycle.

3. Now, go back to your notes/the course material references, and check your work, and rework any parts you may have missed or had out of order. Walk yourself through the launching of an Activity, and navigation through to a second activity, and the back to the Main activity. What lifecycle steps occur? What happens if you kill the app and reopen it?
