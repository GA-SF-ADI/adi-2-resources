## Opening (5 mins)

As we discussed in the last lesson, there are a lot of important steps in the Activity Life Cycle. Now, we are going to concentrate specifically on `onPause` and `onResume`, exploring why they are useful and examples of when to use them. Also, in the last lesson, we talked about saving state using bundles.  To build on that, first, we're going to work on saving persistent data using the Shared Preferences, then, we're going to integrate that into `onPause` and `onResume`.




<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction: Persistent Data with SharedPreferences (15 mins)

Sometimes we need the ability to store and retrieve data even when the app is completely closed. Previously, we were storing data in Bundles, which only lasted while the app was running. There are many ways to persist data, such as files and databases. Android provides a built-in utility for this called `SharedPreferences`. `SharedPreferences` allows you to store any type of data using key-value pairs, where the key is a String, and the value is the data. These preferences remain with the app as long as it is installed.


One popular use for `SharedPreferences` is to hold app settings. For instance, a news aggregator app remembers the type of news articles and the preferred sources you like to receive your news from. You don't want to set this every time, so the app stores this information in `SharedPreferences` for easy retrieval the next time the app launches.



<a name="demo"></a>
## Demo: Persistent Data with SharedPreferences (10 mins)


To start with, we must retrieve the `SharedPreferences` Object from Android for your app.

There are two ways to do this. The first is used if you only need to use these `SharedPreferences` in this one activity:

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getPreferences(Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```

The second way allows you to provide a key that matches a specific `SharedPreferences` file. This key must be unique to your app, such as "com.example.myapp.SOME_KEY_NAME". These preferences, unlike the first, can be retrieved from anywhere in your app:

```java
SharedPreferences sharedPref = context.getSharedPreferences("com.example.myapp.SOME_KEY_NAME",Context.MODE_PRIVATE);
```

With that done, we are now able to read from `SharedPreferences`. To write to `SharedPreferences`, we must retrieve an object called an `Editor`. Let's look at an example for both of these:

```java
//To read String
String str = sharedPreferences.getString("exampleKey","DEFAULT"); //Initial value of the String is "Hello"

//To save String
Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
editor.putString("exampleKey",str+" World!");
editor.commit();
```
After committing the changes, the String with key "exampleKey" now contains the value "Hello World!" instead of "Hello".

## Guided Practice: Persistent Data with SharedPreferences (10 mins)

In this practice, we will adapt the app from the previous lesson that saved the time the app was launched to use `SharedPreferences` instead of a Bundle. In the starter code directory, load the [SharedPreferencesBetweenActivities](starter-code/SharedActivityCreationTime) project.



<a name="independent-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice: Persistent Data with SharedPreferences (15 mins)

Now it's time to save `SharedPreferences` data in one activity and retrieve it in another. We will have an `EditText` with a button in the first activity. When the button is pressed, we will be taken to the next activity and whatever was typed into the text box will be shown in the second activity.

## Introduction: onPause and onResume (15 mins)

As we discussed in the last lesson, there are a number of different methods that are automatically called during the activity creation, pausing, resuming, and destruction processes. Two of those methods are `onPause` and `onResume`.

1. `onPause` is called when user interaction is being taken away, but the activity is still currently visible (although this could change immediately afterwards)
2. `onResume` is called when the activity is visible again and control is being given back to the user

Because these two methods are guaranteed to be called before and after resuming and pausing the activity, respectively, these are the perfect times to perform basic maintenance.

One of the most common uses of these methods is to gain and release system resources. Generally, these are things that can be battery draining (i.e. long running background processes that are only needed while visible, like a streaming video) or system resources that must be acquired (i.e. camera). When resuming, you gain the resource, and when pausing, you release the resource.




<a name="demo"></a>
## Demo: onPause and onResume (5 mins)

In this demo, we will be looking at when `onPause` and `onResume` are called in a situation where the screen is only partially covered but the activity is still viewable in the background.

To do this, we will be using a `Dialog`, which brings a popup over the screen, causing the underlying activity to pause and resume.




<a name="guided-practice"></a>
## Guided Practice: Topic (10 mins)

We are going to be making a basic countdown timer app that is only timing while the initial activity is running. When we switch to another activity, we will pause the time until we return to the first activity.

## Independent Practice: Music Player (15 minutes)


You will be modifying the [provided music player](starter-code/MusicPlayer) to pause the music when a new activity is opened and automatically resume it when the user returns to the activity. Starter code is provided in the MusicPlayer project.

## Conclusion (5 mins)

Today we covered `SharedPreferences` and how `onPause`/`onResume` work together to make your app run smoothly. Understanding how the activity life cycle works and how to use it to your advantage will make your apps have a much smoother user experience.
