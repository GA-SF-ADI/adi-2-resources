#SQLITE HOMEWORK

This homework is going to be done in SQLITE. Because uploading a SQLITE database is difficult, the submissions are going to be screenshots of your queries and query results. T


## 1.  Apps

Create a database of apps! 

Apps should have 
-name
-Rating
-downloads
-description
-free or not

Put some of your favorites in there, then select them each both by their ID and by their name. Screenshot your selections


## 2. Sandwiches

 First, we want you to create a sandwich table. 
 - They need the name, the base (the type of bread)
 - the sauce 
 - the meat
 - the calories. 

 Insert three different sandwiches into the table (your choice!) Finally, using a more complex Query,  select all of them and order them by their calories. Take a screenshot of that. 


## 3. TV Shows

Create a TV shows table! It should have

-Name
-Rating
-Duration of show 
-Station

Add some of your favorite and least favorite tv shows into the table. Finally, run a couple of queries and take screenshots of the results. Get 

-All of the shows
-All of the good shows (Rated 4 stars or above!)
-All of the bad shows (Rated 2 stars or below!)
