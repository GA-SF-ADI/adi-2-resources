# Big-O Lab

## Introduction


In this lab, you will be identifying the type of sort and calculating Big O (worst case performance) of various sorting algorithms.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Identify the type of sort for three pseudocoded algorithms
- Calculate the Big O notation of those algorithms; include **an explanation**

**Bonus**

- Do the same for the fourth algorithm


#### Starter code

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find code for the three pseudocoded algorithms and the bonus.

#### Deliverable

Below each method, write the type of sort, the Big O notation, and an explanation for how you came to that conclusion.
