## Introduction

For this lab, you will start your work towards your final project pitch (at the end of this week) by thinking more about an idea you want to pursue, doing competitive research, and coming up with a research plan including questions for user research.  

## Exercise

#### Part 1: Do competitive research (1:25)

You're going to do competitive research and create a spreadsheet comparing existing apps that feature an idea similar to what you have in mind for your final project. You should spend about an hour and 25 minutes on this portion of the lab.  

For your competitive research:

- Choose 5+ experiences or apps in your project’s industry or an adjacent industry, and analyze them
- Choose one of the two of the competitive analysis formats covered earlier in the course (feature inventory vs. + / Δ), and work to create a competitive analysis for your final project topic:

  - If you choose choose feature inventory focus on this question: What features do other apps offer?
  - If you choose + / Δ, focus on these questions: What does each do well? What does each do poorly?

#### Part 2: Come up with a research plan (1:25)

After you're finished with your competitive research, for the remainder of the lab, you're going to come up with a research plan using the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf). Write a short research plan for your final project that answers the following:

  - What area(s) are you interested in researching?
  - What are your research goals? What are you trying to learn about your topic?
  - Who is your target audience? How will you find them?


- Also, write a script for your final project topic that answers the following:

  - What can you ask about that will help you get at those research goals?
  - Write a list of topics you want to ask about. Then, write questions that correspond to each of those topics.
  - Make sure you’re not leading or biasing the questions.

- **Note**: You will be using this research plan to conduct user interviews tonight!


#### Starter assets

Be sure to use the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf) for your research plan.

For the competitive analysis, create a blank Google Sheet and fill out your columns/rows as needed.

#### Deliverable

For the research plan with user research questions, you should have a completed the [Research Plan Template](starter-assets/research-plan-template.pdf).

The competitive analysis should look something like this, depending on what method you choose:

By the end of this week, you should submit a pull request for your final project with all of your research work; included in that pull request should be the deliverables from this lab included in or linked to in your final project's readme file - read more about project 4's deliverable schedule [here](../../projects/project-04).
