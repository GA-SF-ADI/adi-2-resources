## Introduction


This lab will help you get more practice with searching.

## Exercise

### Whiteboard Practice

You are given 3 arrays to search. Write your solutions on a whiteboard, showing the steps for each search. Take photos of the answers. For example:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

To find the number 7 in the array above, the steps are:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
6, 7, 8
7
```

---

Search the arrays below:

- 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 || Find 16

- 1, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24 || Find 20

- -22, 7, 33, 12, 0, 0, -9, 66, 94, 103, 34, 54, 12, 54, 80, 90, 2 || Find 34

**Bonus:**

With the following set, show the steps of the binary search, as well as the sorting beforehand. Sort in any way you feel is best:

- 94, 103, 34, 54, 12, 54, 80, 90, 2 || Find 80

**Bonus #2**

In either pseudocode or Java, write the algorithm for binary search *recursively*. Take a pic of it, or save it in a file and submit it as a pull request.

#### Deliverable

Pictures of each of your solutions and the Java file if you complete the bonus.
