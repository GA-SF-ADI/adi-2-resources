## Introduction


In this lab, you will be practicing the Bubble Sort and Insert Sort algorithms.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

This lab will be split up into two sections: the practice and the interview sections.

**Practice: 45 minutes**

Below, you will find a handful of number arrays. By hand, sort as many as you can *with your partner(s)*. For the ones you sort, use both the Bubble and Insert methods. Using either the table or the walls, draw and photograph your work; or create a text file and record your work there. Be sure to record your results after after each pass through each array for both methods.






*Bonus:*

Sort this one, too!


**Interview: 20 - 30 minutes**

One person will act as the interviewee, and the other(s) will act as the interviewer(s). The interviewers will give the interviewee a random array of numbers of about the same length as the arrays above. The interviewee has 10 minutes to sort the numbers via Insert Sort. After 10 minutes, change roles, and if you have a group, repeat until everyone has gone.

#### Deliverable

A file or photos detailing all of the results of the practice. Nothing to submit for the interview section.
