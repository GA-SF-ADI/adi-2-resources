## Introduction


This lab will help you gain more practice using Merge Sort.

## Exercise

Similar to previous bubble and insertion sort labs, this lab will be split up into two sections: practice and interview.

### Practice

There are 6 arrays listed below. For each one, draw out the Merge Sort diagram, showing each step of your process as you split up the array - also, include the steps needed to merge everything back together.

**[-5,20,3,2,22]**

**[4,-4,3,-3,1,0]**

**[-3,1,0,0,5,2]**

**[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]**

**[1,-5,77,28,15,91,-8,23,52,44,140,14,23,41]**

**[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]**

### Interview

One person will play the interviewee, and the others will play the interviewer(s). The interviewers will give the interviewee an array of numbers, similar to the arrays above. The interviewee has 10 minutes to sort the numbers via Merge Sort. After 10 minutes, students should swap roles. Repeat until everyone has gone.

#### Deliverable

Take pictures of the diagram for each practice problem and include those pictures are part of your submitted pull request. Nothing to submit for the interview section.
