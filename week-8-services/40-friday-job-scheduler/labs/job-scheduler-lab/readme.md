This lab will be building off of yesterday's external ContentProvider lab. You need to create a JobScheduler that sends notifications when you have an upcoming Calendar Event. 

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create a JobService that can access your Calendar 
- Send a Notification whenever there is an event within a certain amount of time

#### Deliverable

An Android app that follows the requirements above. There are no design requirements. If you would like to work on the UI, please feel free to modify it but prioritize the app's functionality, first.

When testing the app, make sure your phone is connected to your email account and has at least a few calendar upcoming events. Otherwise, you won't be recieving notifications.
