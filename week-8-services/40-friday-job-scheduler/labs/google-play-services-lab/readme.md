## Introduction


We covered implementing FireBase Analytics during the lesson along with FireBase Notifications, both extremely useful in their own right.

There are many other services, though, and one of the most popular is the **location service**.

In this lab, you will be creating an app that uses the location service to get the user's current location and prints the latitude and longitude values inside of a text view. You will also add a button that will pass this location information to Google Maps App!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Have a button to that will grab location and put it into a text view
- Have a button that will pass the user latitude and longitude to the Maps Application!
- Use the [location API](http://developer.android.com/training/location/retrieve-current.html) to get the user's current location
- Open [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/intents) to show the user's current location

**Bonus:**
- Read the Google Maps link above and load all **restaurants** near your user's current location!
- Display the map inside of your app rather than opening the Google Maps app.

#### Starter code

No starter code!

**You should use your solutions form the independent practice exercise**. Location services requires the use of `google-services.json` file which we generated in the lesson to get FireBase Notifications and Analytics working. Re-using that code we don't have to generate another `google-services.json` file!

#### Deliverable

A working app that meets the requirements above.

Don't forget to request [location permissions!](http://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html).

#### Hints 

Please refrain from using these hints **unless you are truly stuck and spent a lot of time reading the documentation**.
These are here to keep you from spending all day on the lab.

        return;
    }
    // We have location, lets grab the latitude and longitude values
    double lat = lastLocation.getLatitude();
    double lon = lastLocation.getLongitude();

    // concatenate the lat and long variables in the required format. Refer to docs.
    Uri gmmIntentUri = Uri.parse("google.streetview:cbll=" + lat + "," + lon +"\"");

    // Create an Intent from gmmIntentUri. Set the action to ACTION_VIEW
    Intent mapIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, gmmIntentUri);
    
    // Make the Intent explicit by setting the Google Maps package
    mapIntent.setPackage("com.google.android.apps.maps");

    // Attempt to start an activity that can handle the Intent
    startActivity(mapIntent);
}
