## Introduction


We covered implementing Analytics during the lesson, an extremely important part of play services that lets you track your user interactions with your app. There are many other services, though, and one of the most popular is the location service.

In this lab, you will be creating an app that uses the location service to get the user's current location, and allow them to press a button to open a map preset to show where they are. **Use the links in the additional resources section** to learn about the locations service and how to implement it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Have a button to open maps
- Use the location API to get the user's current location
- Open Google Maps to show the user's current location

**Bonus:**
- Display the map inside of your app rather than opening the Google Maps app

#### Starter code

Using starter code is completely optional. You have three options:

1. Start your app from scratch for extra practice
2. Use your solution code from the lesson's Independent practice
3. Use the starter-code from the provided folder, which is our solution code for the Independent practice

If you choose options 1 or 2, remove the project in the starter-code folder and put yours in there.

#### Deliverable

A working app that meets the requirements above.
