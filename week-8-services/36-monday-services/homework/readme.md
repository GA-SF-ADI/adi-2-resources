#Services Homework

## Project

Included in this file is a chaching.mp3 audio file. What we want you to do is add some functionality to your project 2! 

Specifically, we want you to create an `OnClickListener` for your purchase button —if you don't have a purchase button, just put one where it would make sense— that starts an `IntentService` that plays the chaching.mp3 file then stops! Create this service from scratch!

## Writing

There is one more thing we want you to do, just answer two simple questions in the answers.md file. 

- What is the difference between an `IntentService` , a regular `Service` and a `BoundedService` ?

- What are three examples in apps that you use that you think are using a `Service`?
