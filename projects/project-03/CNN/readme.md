#### Overview

Project 3 is your opportunity to really let your creativity shine! You will have the basic app requirements, provided by CNN, but it is up to you to do user research and design everything. This app will allow the user to discover, follow, and share breaking news. You will also have the opportunity to integrate various APIs, including Twitter and Facebook, as well as a news API.

**You will be working in groups for this project**. The project will be spread across **three weeks**, with separate deliverables due at the end of each week. Although the deliverables will be separate, we will be incorporating them all into a single app, expanding upon the previous week's work. The first week will focus on the research; the second week on your group's project proposal, synthesis from your research, and a basic UI; and the third week on the technical implementation - integrating the various APIs, design and functionality together.

- Complete as much of the layout as possible before working on your logic.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code. Thinking through the logic helps.
- Test functionality as soon as you complete it.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 27 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _(If applicable) Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
