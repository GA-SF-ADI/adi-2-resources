#### Overview

During Project 3, ADI students will work in groups to design and build an application that meets a set of technical and design specifications. Each set of specifications has been provided by the Android team at a real company--the idea is for students to work as part of a team on a real-world challenge. Each group of students should choose from the below list of available project briefs:  

* [CNN](CNN)
* [Vice](vice)
* [Yelp](Yelp)

Multiple groups will be assigned to the same project brief--these projects have been designed to be fairly open-ended and will allow for a great deal of creativity with regard to design, implementation and interaction. Students will have two weeks to work on this project. Please see the individual project briefs for more information on project requirements.
