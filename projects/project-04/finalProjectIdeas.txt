So there are a couple of ideas I am contemplating for my final project but I want to make sure they are reasonable for me to accomplish in the allotted time frame.  In terms of difficulty I am ok doing something that’s up to an 8/10 in terms of complexity based on my skillset.  The most important thing to me is that I am not overly stressed out about hitting the core requirements and whether the app executes in time for submission.I ideally would like to create an app that has entrepreneurial potential.1.) Closet organizer app.  You take a series of selfies of all the different clothing configurations in your closet.  You categorize them based on level of formality, your personal rating and sex appeal.  There is also a text field where you can enter "to dos" for items to purchase that might be nice for augmenting a given outfit.  APIs I could call are daily weather and maybe Pinterest.2.) On demand babysitting.  I had visualized this with an uber-like platform but from what Jamey tells me it sounds like that’s not feasible.  Any ideas as to how I might implement this3.) On demand picture taking of a given location / private investigation services with an uber-type platform.  I would call it "SpySTER".4.) On demand tour guide app.5.) App that lists all ballet studios and their classes schedule based on your location.6.) Children’s toy swapping app for parents based on age and locationPlease advise, I really appreciate your suggestions.  I am excited to get started.  Thank you so much!
