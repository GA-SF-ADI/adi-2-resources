> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

## Exercise

For this lab, you will be testing a simple ATM app with Espresso. You will be given User Stories and are expected to test features based on them.

You will need to import the [starter code](starter-code) to get the app.

Take some time to play around with the app, see how it works. Also, familiarize yourself with the ids that the project uses.

**Bonus:**

* As a user, I can see a list of my previous transactions.

* Add any additional tests you feel would be good to have.
