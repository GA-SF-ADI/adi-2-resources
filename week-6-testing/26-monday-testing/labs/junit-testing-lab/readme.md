## Introduction

Using the code from a previous lab - where we created and worked with an Animal class and a Zoo class - you are going to write tests (that pass) for the code in this "Zoo App".  For more context, read the Introduction from the lab we're referring too:

  *This lab will continue our subclasses lab where we created subclasses of Animals. Instead of storing all of our Animals in an ArrayList, we're going to store all of them in a Zoo class that is a Singleton. If you remember from the lesson, a Singleton is a class where only one instance exists in memory. In addition to giving our Animal objects a new place to live, the Zoo will make sure our Animals only exist once in memory.*

  *In addition, you're going to add a method, `makeNoise()`, that returns the sound that animal makes as a String. All this will take place in an Android app, and when the user presses on the Animal in the list, a Toast should pop up with whatever the corresponding Animal's noise ("Roar","Hiss","Meow" etc.).*



## Exercise

#### Requirements

[The code provided](starter-code) is the solution code from from the "Zoo App".  Write tests to make sure:

- The animals make their appropriate sounds
- The animals have their appropriate top speeds
- The Zoo properly adds and removes animals


##### Bonus

- Create a new animal and write appropriate tests for it

#### Starter code

The [starter code](starter-code) is the solution code to OOP practice lab.

You can use your previous code, if you would like to.

#### Deliverable

An app with passing tests!
