## Introduction

We've just learned about RxJava syntax and usage, especially for networking calls. Now we're going to give you a bit of time to practice this on your own. 

## Exercise

Rework one of your previous lesson projects, labs, or group project to use RxJava for networking

#### Requirements

- Use Retrofit and an interface to get data from an API
- Use RxJava for networking with at least one Observable pattern

**Bonus:**
- Use RetroLambdas
- Use an RxJava operator to rework another portion of your code


#### Deliverable

- An app/project you have reworked to use RxJava for networking.
