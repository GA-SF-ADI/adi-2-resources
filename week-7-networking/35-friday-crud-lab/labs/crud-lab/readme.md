## Exercise

In this lab, you will be using https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/ to create a simple app!

The app should have a simple list of the returned results and allow you to click on them for more detail. The app should also account for tablet devices.


#### Requirements

Your email client must show/do the following:

* An Activity that displays a list of books
* An Activity with Edit Texts that allows users to create a book
* A detailed activity that allows users to edit books
* Give users the ability to delete books
* Must use a class, like _Book.java_, that defines the result objects

**Bonus**:

Though not required, try to aim for the following goals:

* Use material design
* Add a way to search the books
* All of the same functionality but for wines instead of books! 

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio application that meets the above requirements.
