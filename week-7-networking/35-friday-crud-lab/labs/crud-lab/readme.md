# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Build a simple CRUD APP

> Instructors Note: This is meant as an alternative to the building an email client lab, while that was a good and challenging lab, many students complained that it was using an SDK to make API calls instead of testing their ability to make them manually using Retrofit or any of the tools we had been teaching them. This lab instead uses an API that SF WDI instructors built, and while it is much easier and less concrete, it builds off of the the appropriate lessons and is much more achievable.

## Exercise

In this lab, you will be using [WDI'S Super Crud](super-crud.herokuapp.com) to create a simple app!

The app should have a simple list of the returned results and allow you to click on them for more detail. The app should also account for tablet devices.


#### Requirements

Your email client must show/do the following:

* A list of books that shows up
* A screen for viewing the contents of an book that is seen when clicking an item in the list of books
* Must use a class, like _Book.java_, that defines the result objects
* Fulfil the four CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Destroy

**Bonus**:

Though not required, try to aim for the following goals:

* Use material design
* Add a way to search the books
* All of the same functionality but for wines instead of books! 

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio application that meets the above requirements.
