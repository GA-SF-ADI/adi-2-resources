A whole grain food is made by using all three parts of the grain. All General Mills Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient. Same Cheerios, simply gluten free. The taste you love has always come from oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of time together. Now that Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share breakfast, and we couldn't be happier. After all, bringing families together around the breakfast table is exactly why we're here.&lt;/p&gt;","longDescription":"&lt;b&gt;Cheerios Gluten Free Cereal:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made with 100% whole grain oats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can help lower cholesterol as part of a heart healthy diet (Three grams of soluble fiber daily from whole grain oat foods, like Cheerios Cereal, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.
