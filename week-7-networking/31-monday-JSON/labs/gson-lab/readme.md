> ***Note:*** _This should be done in pairs._

We have provided you in the starter code two JSON strings one from[here](https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20weather.forecast%20where%20woeid%20in%20(select%20woeid%20from%20geo.places(1)%20where%20text%3D%22nome%2C%20ak%22)&format=json&env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys) the other from [here](https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists?ids=2CIMQHirSU0MQqyYHq0eOx,57dN52uHvrHOxijzpIgu3E,1vCWHaC5f2uS3yhpwWbIA6)!

We want you to create models for the two JSON strings we gave you AND model out the JSON object for the model we gave you. Ideally, you will finish this by creating two buttons to display the data either in JSON or GSON format. 


#### Deliverable

An Android Studio project, with no particular format.
