# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) API and GSON Lab

> ***Note:*** _This should be done in pairs._

You were provided with a handful of APIs to start with, which were briefly explored in the GSON lesson. For this lab, explore the [Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory), find an API (either pure REST or an API-backed SDK) and get data from it. Finally, parse that data using GSON, create the necessary classes, and display the data in a way that's meaningful or fun for you - the choice is yours!  Go crazy!

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- One restriction: You ***cannot*** use the Walmart API or the Gmail SDK.

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio project, with no particular format.

#### Resources

Here are the docs from the APIs we discussed in the lesson:

* [Marvel](http://developer.marvel.com/)
* [Yahoo Weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/)
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
* [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/)

Here's a fun API:
