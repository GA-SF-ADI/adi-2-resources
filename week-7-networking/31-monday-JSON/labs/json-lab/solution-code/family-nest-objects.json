This is an example of how data should be stored in a nested object:
```
{
    "Yuliya" : {
        "age" : "27",
    	"quality" : "talkative",
    	"appearance" : {
    		"eyes" : "hazel",
    		"hair" : "long"
    	}
    },
    "Olga" : {
        "age" : "27",
    	"quality" : "smart",
    	"appearance" : {
    		"eyes" : "blue",
    		"hair" : "short"
    	}
    }
}
```
