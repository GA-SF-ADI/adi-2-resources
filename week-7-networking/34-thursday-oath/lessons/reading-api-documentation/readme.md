## Opening (5 mins)

Being able to read and quickly navigate documentation is an invaluable skill to have as a software developer in any field. Many companies provide services with their own custom documentation, and sometimes, the only way for you to understand how to use it is by reading their documentation. Sometimes this is easy and other times, very difficult. Today we're going to be exploring a few different API documentations and learn how to effectively use them.

## Introduction: What is API Documentation (10 mins)

Documentation for programming in general is crucial for other developers to be able to easily interpret and reuse your code. This is especially true with API documentation since it is designed specifically for other developers to use. Some APIs are very simple, while others are very complicated, but they all share some things in common. They all remove some of the complications for interacting with other systems and provide the users with the information they require, as well as the information they give back.


As we saw in a few of our previous lessons, many APIs also require some form of authentication, either to keep track of how many requests an app makes, or because sensitive information needs to be accessed. While we are mostly going to be focusing on API documentation today, the information really applies to any documentation you might encounter in your career as a developer.

## Guided Practice: "Bad" Documentation (10 mins)

Bad documentation doesn't necessarily mean it is short or incomplete. You can have very extensive documentation which can still be viewed as "bad". One example of this is the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/).


What do you notice about this?

At first glance, it looks like there is a lot of great information packed in there! However, as you start reading, there are sections where they use vocabulary with no explanation, or have you copying large sections of code with no description of what it's doing.

## Independent Practice: Retrofit (10 mins)

Review the [Retrofit documentation](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) with your partner, and discuss at least 5 likes and 5 dislikes you have about it. Would you classify it as good or bad?

## Guided Practice: "Good" Documentation (15 mins)

Good documentation includes some of the following:

- Well-organized code
- Thorough explanations
- Complete code samples
- It is regularly updated
- Request and response information (if applicable)

One example of some very well maintained documentation is the [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android).


They expose some of the most common functionality near the top of the page (Login and Sharing).

The "Quick Start Guide" not only includes code, but also pictures of Android Studio and the website to register your app.

## Independent Practice: Exploring Documentation (25 mins)

Google Maps is a very popular API used in many apps that require a map to be shown. In pairs, you will use the [Google Maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/) to make an app with a map shown on the screen.

Maps is relatively straightforward, and this will give you more experience working with Google's APIs as well as the developer's console. Feel free to get creative and use features of the API!

## Conclusion (5 mins)

Practice is one of the best ways to get better at using documentation, and filling in any gaps that may exist in documentation you are using. Unfortunately there aren't universal standards everyone uses, but in general the more popular APIs have well-kept documentation for you to use. In addition, if you are having an issue, Google is your friend to possibly finding the answer. Chances are that other people have similar problems to what you are encountering.

- What should you look for in "Good" API documentation?
