## Preparing for the OAuth lesson

In the upcoming OAuth lesson, we will be working with the Instagram API. In order to save some time during the lesson, you will be setting up your Instagram account. Please follow the instructions below.

We will discuss the details of these steps during the lesson. **Please let someone from the instructional team know if you have any questions.**

First and foremost, you must have an Instagram account. If you don't already have one, please sign up. Once you are signed in, visit Instagram's [developer site](https://instagram.com/developer/). Here you will see an option in the navbar to "Manage Clients". Click it. Once [here](https://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/) register your application by clicking on the "Register a New Client" button. You should see the following:

![register client](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/26180R00453o1D1q171i/Image%202015-11-08%20at%2012.55.00%20PM.png)

- **Application Name:** Choose anything you want
- **Description:** Anything you want
- **Website URL:** This can be any valid url
- **valid redirect URIs:** Same as Website URL
- **Contact Email:** Your email address


After you fill out the form you'll have something similar to the following:

![register client form](https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2B2g2J1d1l200q190h44/Image%202015-11-08%20at%2012.57.36%20PM.png)

Once all of this information is complete, click the Register button.

Once you have completed registering your client, you will see your `CLIENT ID`, `CLIENT SECRET`, and `REDIRECT URI ` and other information pertaining to your Instagram app on the [Manage Clients](https://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/) view. We will be using all of these during the OAuth lesson.
