## Introduction

In this lab, you will be exploring the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/). Use the prompts below to find the correct API call.

## Exercise

First, sign up for a Yahoo! account (sorry, there's no way to avoid it). Get the API key and save it somewhere.

Allocate 15 minutes for each task.

- Task #1: Find the api call that allows you to search for all images of "cats".

- Task #2: Find the api call that allows you to search for all images from "Charlotte, North Carolina."

- Task #3: Get all of the comments for any photo.

- Task #4: Search for a list of all the photos at your current latitude and longitude.

**Bonus**:

- For each task/API endpoint, write Java code that takes in the JSON result and creates a Java Object (GSON!)


#### Requirements

- Add the correct API calls in the [answers.md](answers.md) file
- If you attempt or complete the bonus, include your Java code in the pull request

#### Deliverable

A filled out [answers.md](answers.md) file.
