## Introduction

In this lab, you will be exploring the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/). Use the prompts below to find the correct API call.

## Exercise

First, sign up for a Yahoo! account (sorry, there's no way to avoid it). Get the API key and save it somewhere.

Allocate 15 minutes for each task.

- Task #1: Find the api call that allows you to search for all images of "cats".

- Task #2: Find the api call that allows you to search for all images from "Charlotte, North Carolina."

- Task #3: Get all of the comments for any photo.

- Task #4: Search for a list of all the photos at your current latitude and longitude.

**Bonus**:

- For each task/API endpoint, write Java code that calls the API and returns a JSON object
- For task #1, using IntelliJ, write a script that hits the API endpoint you've identified, loops through the returned data, and prints out (to the console) just the URL of each cat image
- For task #3, using IntelliJ, write a script that hits the API endpoint you've identified, loops through the returned comments for the first photo at your current lat/long, and prints out (to the console) the first word of each comment...backwards!


#### Requirements

- Add the correct API calls in the [answers.md](answers.md) file
- If you attempt or complete the bonus, include your Java code in the pull request

#### Deliverable

A filled out [answers.md](answers.md) file.
