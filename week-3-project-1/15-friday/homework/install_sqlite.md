## Please install sqlite for Monday's lesson

You'll need to have sqlite3 working to do the first part of Monday's lesson.

Here's the installation instructions for sqlite:

This will utilize your command line skills. If you get a 'command not found' error when trying to use the 'make' command (mac), please check that you have installed the developer tools (see [this] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1469994/using-make-on-osx) SO post).

Please verify that you have the installation done by typing `sqlite3` in terminal and seeing that it opens an instance of sqlite. You can exit with the command `.quit`.
