#Weekend Homework

First of all, congradulations on finishing project 1! The concepts we have learned so far are going to be used in the future, so we want to give you some practice this weekend going over classes/subclasses/custom adapters! But before we get to that, we are going to be going over databases next week and we need you to install some things. Instructions for that are [here](install_sqlite.md). DON'T FORGET TO DO THIS. 

##Install Sqlite

Follow the instructions [here](install_sqlite.md). 

## Basic Java

If you want some more review of your basic Java, variable types, ArrayLists, methods, etc., we have compiled a list of resources [here](/java-practice). Take a look, and if you are feeling uncertain about anything, look at the drills at the bottom of the readme. 

If you want additional practice, Udemy has a nice, free basic java online class full of videos and other resources located [here](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

## Classes

We have compiled a list of helpful resources and readings on Classes, Subclasses, and Interfaces. It is a lot, but we want you to look through those readings. You can find those readings [here](/java-practice/classes-practice). The material should mostly be review. 

## Custom Adapters

We want you to review custom adapters again. As an exercise, we want you to try and recreate the Pandora station ListView with a Custom Adapter and a Station object. You don't need to worry about icons or correct images, what is important is that you can model each station correctly and get that stations data to display in a list programatically. Good luck!

##Install

As a final reminder, [REMEMBER TO INSTALL SQLITE](install_sqlite.md).
