# OOP fundamentals Homework

This homework is intented to be a review to solidify your understanding of some Object Oriented Programming concepts. Although some of these concepts are high-level, they are important to the language (Java) that we work in as Android developers, and understanding these concepts will help you with interview question preparation.

In your own words, come up with answers to the following, using diagrams or pictures also if it helps you to describe the concept. 

1. What are the 4 main characteristics of OOP, and what do they mean? 

	i. For each of the 4 OOP concepts, explain an example where the concept could apply practically to Android development.

	ii. Are there any tradeoffs between these concepts in your opinion? If so, what are they?

2. Abstract classes and Interfaces are useful in Java and in Android development. Explain an example of an Interface we use often in Android. 

	i. What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface? If you don't know, that's alright - look it up and rephrase in your own words.

	ii. How do Interfaces and Abstract Classes relate to polymorphism? Can you give an example of this from lessons or labs that we've talked about?

3. We often use private member variables when creating classes. Why is it good to have private member variables instead of public? How do we grant access to such variables usually?

4. For further reading, we'd like you to check out Java 8 Pocket Guide Chapter 5: Classes and Objects, all the way up through the Interfaces section.
