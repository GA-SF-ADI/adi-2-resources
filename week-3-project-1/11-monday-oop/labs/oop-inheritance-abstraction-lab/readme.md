# Abstraction - Household

## Introduction


In this lab, you will be designing an app that creates and maintains Households. All Households will be able to gain income and pay 20% of their income in taxes. All Households will also have a Pet. All Pets can be fed, groomed, and played with.

You can express the state or action of something by printing messages to the command line, such as "Household sells X to gain income" or "Play fetch".

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create at least 1 Abstract Class
- Use at least 1 Interface
- Create at least 2 households, each with a different kind of Pet
- Use polymorphism to have each household gain income, pay their taxes, and care for their pet (feed, play with, and groom) in one loop

Bonus:

- Add additional classes/subclasses

#### Starter code

In the [starter code](starter-code) folder, you will find a Driver class with the main method. This class will be where you implement all of your households.

#### Deliverable

A simple Java program that has at least two households. Print statements can be used to show their behavior.
