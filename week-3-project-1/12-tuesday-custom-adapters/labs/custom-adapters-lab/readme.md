## Introduction

This lab is to help you practice with creating and using custom adapters.

You are creating a Five Day Forecast app. You can design it anyway you want. Just ensure that the requirements have been met.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* Lists the forecast, backed by a list of Forecast objects
* The app shows at least 5 forecasts
* Each list item has three text views: day, high, and low

**Bonus:**

* Each list item contains a small image describing the weather
* Clicking on a list item opens a new screen, showing more information about that forecast

#### Starter code

There is no starter code. After forking and cloning this repo, create a new Android Studio project. There is nothing to import.

#### Deliverables

A compilable Android project.
